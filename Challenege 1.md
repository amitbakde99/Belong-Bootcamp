1.Write a Python program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them. Input “fname” as your first name and “lname” as your last name. Test it for Harry Potter.
-->
fname=input()
lname=input()
print(lname+fname)

2.Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user. Input “r” as the radius of the circle that can accept float values also. Define the value of pi as 3.14.
-->
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print("The area of the circle is:", area)

3.Write a Python program to calculate the sum of three given numbers. Take the 3 inputs from the user and print the result.
-->
sum_of_numbers = sum(float(input()) for _ in range(3))
print(sum_of_numbers)

4.Write a Python program that determines whether a given number (accepted from the user) is even or odd, and prints either Even or Odd after testing the number.
-->
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd")

5.Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of (n+n*n+n*n*n
-->
n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
result = n + n * n + n * n * n
print("Result:", result)

6.Write a Python program to solve (x + y) * (x + y)
-->
x = 5
y = 3
result = (x + y) ** 2
print(result)

7.Write a python program to print greater of the two input numbers. Input a and b as two numbers. If a is greater than b then print “a is greater”. If b is greater than a print “b is greater”
-->
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

if a > b:
    print("a is greater")
elif b > a:
    print("b is greater")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal")

8.Write a python code to perform the following operations on two input numbers ( a and b) on a new lines. Sum, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Power
-->
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Sum
sum_result = a + b
print("Sum:", sum_result)

# Subtraction
subtraction_result = a - b
print("Subtraction:", subtraction_result)

# Multiplication
multiplication_result = a * b
print("Multiplication:", multiplication_result)

# Division
if b != 0:
    division_result = a / b
    print("Division:", division_result)
else:
    print("Division: Cannot divide by zero")

# Modulo
if b != 0:
    modulo_result = a % b
    print("Modulo:", modulo_result)
else:
    print("Modulo: Cannot perform modulo with zero")

# Power
power_result = a ** b
print("Power:", power_result)
